FIRST COMMENT (Maker Introduction):
-----------------------------------
Hey Product Hunt! 👋

I'm David Cooper (CCIE #14019), and I built $KILLSWITCH after realizing AI agents lack something every human worker has: someone who can tell them to STOP.

**Why this matters:**

Last year, an autonomous agent deleted my staging database because it misunderstood "clean up old data." That 2AM incident inspired $KILLSWITCH.

**What it does:**

$KILLSWITCH sits between your AI agent and the outside world, blocking dangerous actions in real-time:

- 🔴 **Kill Switch** - Stop any agent instantly (<100ms)
- 🚫 **Action Blocking** - Define forbidden actions (delete, exec, etc.)
- 🛡️ **Target Protection** - Block access to sensitive files/APIs
- 💰 **Spending Limits** - Prevent runaway costs
- 📊 **Risk Scoring** - Automatic risk assessment
- 📝 **Audit Trail** - Complete action history

**Quick start:**
```python
pip install runtime-fence

from runtime_fence import RuntimeFence, FenceConfig

fence = RuntimeFence(FenceConfig(
    agent_id="my-agent",
    blocked_actions=["delete", "exec"],
    spending_limit=100.0
))

# All agent actions now go through the fence
```

**Who needs this?**

- Anyone using AutoGPT, LangChain, or custom agents
- Developers building AI-powered automation
- Teams deploying autonomous systems
- Companies with compliance requirements

**Open source & privacy-first:**
- MIT licensed
- Works offline (no API required)
- Self-hosted option
- Optional cloud dashboard

Would love your feedback! What safety features would you want for your AI agents?


DESCRIPTION (longer):
---------------------
# Emergency Stop for Your AI Agents

$KILLSWITCH is an open-source safety layer for AI agents. Think of it as a circuit breaker that prevents AI from causing damage.

## The Problem

AI agents can:
- Delete production databases
- Spend thousands on API calls
- Leak sensitive credentials
- Execute dangerous commands
- Transfer funds without approval

And they do all this in milliseconds.

## The Solution

$KILLSWITCH validates every action before it happens:

1. **Real-time Validation** - Every agent action passes through the fence
2. **Risk Scoring** - Automatic assessment of potential damage
3. **Instant Kill** - Emergency stop in under 100ms
4. **Audit Trail** - Complete log of what was attempted vs allowed
5. **Alerts** - Email/SMS when suspicious activity occurs

## How It Works

Wrap your AI agent with Runtime Fence:

```python
from runtime_fence import RuntimeFence, FenceConfig

fence = RuntimeFence(FenceConfig(
    agent_id="my-coding-assistant",
    blocked_actions=["delete", "exec", "rm"],
    blocked_targets=["production", ".env", "api_keys"],
    spending_limit=50.0
))

# Validate before allowing
result = fence.validate("delete", "user_data.sql")
if result.allowed:
    # Proceed
else:
    print(f"Blocked: {result.reasons}")
```

## Features

**Core Protection:**

- Any Python application
- REST API for any language

## Pricing

- **Open Source**: Free forever (MIT license)
- **Cloud Dashboard**: $5-50/month (optional)
- **Enterprise**: Custom pricing for teams

## Tech Stack

- Python 3.10+
- TypeScript/React dashboard
- Self-hosted or cloud

Twitter/X Launch Thread:

🧵 1/7
Just launched $KILLSWITCH on @ProductHunt! 

It's an emergency kill switch for AI agents. Because your AI should have an off button.

[link to PH]

2/7
The problem: AI agents can delete databases, spend $$$, or leak secrets in milliseconds.

The solution: Validate every action before it happens.

[demo GIF]

3/7
Quick demo - watch this agent try (and fail) to:
❌ Delete production files
❌ Spend $5,000 on APIs
❌ Read .env secrets

All blocked automatically.

[video clip]

4/7
Installation is 2 lines:

pip install runtime-fence

Then wrap your agent. That's it.

Works with LangChain, AutoGPT, or any Python code.

5/7
Features:
🔴 <100ms kill switch
🚫 Action blocking
💰 Spending limits
📊 Risk scoring
📝 Full audit logs
📧 Real-time alerts

Open source (MIT) + optional cloud dashboard

6/7
Built this after an AI agent deleted my staging DB at 2AM.

If you're building with AI agents, you need safety controls.

This is that.

HUNTER PITCH (if you know someone):
----------------------------------
Hey [Name],

I built an open-source kill switch for AI agents and would love your support launching on Product Hunt!

**Quick pitch:**
$KILLSWITCH prevents AI agents from causing damage by validating every action in real-time. Think circuit breaker for AI.

**Why it matters:**
AI agents are getting powerful but lack safety controls. This gives developers an emergency stop + guardrails.

**Traction so far:**
- Open source (MIT)
- Works with LangChain/AutoGPT
- <100ms response time
- Full audit trail

Target audience: AI developers, automation teams, anyone using autonomous agents

Would you consider hunting it? Happy to provide demos, early access, or anything else helpful!
